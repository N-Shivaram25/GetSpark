Create a voice-interactive web project named “Get Spark” with two main modes — Keyflow and Img Key Mode — focused on visualizing spoken sentences and keywords using the ClipDrop API or user-mapped images.
🧭 1. Landing Page

    Title of the website: “Get Spark”

    Below the title, place a black button labeled “Get Started”

    On clicking the button, the user is navigated to the main interaction page

🧑‍💻 2. Main Interaction Page (after clicking “Get Started”)
🔲 Top Right Corner Features:

    Insert Keywords – A button or option to allow users to input words or sentences one at a time.

        There should be a "Done" button to finish keyword entry.

    Keyflow Mode – A button that activates core speech-to-visual functionality using keywords and the ClipDrop API.

    Img Key Mode – Another button next to “Keyflow Mode” that enables custom image-to-keyword mapping with additional options.

🧠 3. Keyflow Mode Functionality

    After inserting keywords using the “Insert Keywords” option:

        As the user speaks sentences, the app:

            Captures and displays the spoken text dynamically at the top of the page, within a fixed box having a light black border.

            The box should display only 6 lines of text at a time.

            When it reaches the 6th line:

                New sentence begins typing from the end space of the 6th line.

                Existing lines shift upward, and the topmost (1st) line disappears.

    When any of the inserted keywords are spoken for the first time:

        An image is generated and displayed below the sentence box using the ClipDrop API.

        The image:

            Is shown only the first time the keyword is detected.

            Appears for 6 seconds, then disappears automatically.

        Any repeat of that keyword will not trigger the image again.

🖼️ 4. Img Key Mode Functionality

    In this mode, users can manually create mappings between keywords/sentences and one or more images.

    The input interface should include:

        A box to input the keyword or sentence.

        A corresponding box to upload one or more images.

        An option to define the time duration (in seconds) for how long the image(s) should be shown.

        A “Bullet Points” toggle option.

🎤 During Voice Input in Img Key Mode:

    Spoken sentences should appear in the same 6-line box format as in Keyflow Mode.

    If a keyword (with mapped images) is detected in the spoken input:

        The sentence should appear as a bullet point, if the bullet option was selected.

        A 2-line space should appear between the fixed 6-line sentence box and the bullet point(s).

        If an image is mapped:

            It should appear below the bullet point, with a 1-line space below the image.

            If two or more images are mapped to the same keyword, they should appear side-by-side.

        The 6-line sentence box should dynamically resize to accommodate bullet points and images with the above spacing.

    If the image is optional (not added), only the bullet point is shown.

    All display times for the images are based on the user-defined time value during keyword-image mapping.
