🎨 1. Landing Page Design

    Display only the project title: “Get Spark” using a stylish, creative font (no subtext or extra elements).

    Use a clean, light theme — avoid dark backgrounds and remove excessive vibrance.

    Below the title, place a simple, centered “Get Started” button.

    On click, it should navigate to the main application interface.

🖼️ 2. Main Interface Page (Light Theme)

    Keep the overall design in a light-colored theme for better readability and calm aesthetics.

    At the top right, show two buttons:

        ✅ Insert Keywords (for inputting words/phrases)

        ✅ Mode Selection: “Keyflow” and “Img Key Mode”

🔁 3. Voice-to-Text Flow Fix

    While speaking:

        If there is a pause or break in voice, the text should not automatically move to a new line.

        Text should continue on the same line until it reaches the end or punctuation (like . or ,) is spoken.

        Only use punctuation rules (not silence) to determine line breaks.

📸 4. Img Key Mode Keyword Matching Fix

    Currently, when keywords appear in the middle of a spoken sentence, the system fails to detect and trigger image display.

    Fix this by:

        Ensuring real-time keyword detection within continuous sentence flow, not just isolated words.

        Matching should work even if the keyword is embedded in a longer sentence.

    When a keyword is spoken (and mapped):

        The corresponding image should appear immediately below the text for the configured duration.

        Follow existing layout: bullet point (if selected), then image, then line spacing.

✅ Final Notes for Developer

    Ensure sentence box respects:

        No new line on silence — continue until punctuation.

        Live keyword matching mid-sentence.

    Remove dark theme entirely from both landing and main interface.

    Use modern, elegant design (light grey/white tones, soft shadows, minimalistic look).

    Ensure user interactions are smooth and visuals trigger accurately in Img Key Mode.
